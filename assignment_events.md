> In your own words, explain the React core concept of encapsulation. Discuss why this React principle is important in application development.

A: Encapsulated components are those that isolate their state entirely from other components and communicate with each other minimally via passing props.  It's important to hide information of one component from others so that the two components aren't coupled too strongly.  If you need to change something about one component, other components shouldn't fail.  It also makes for easier testing.  Ideally, you want minimal coupling between components.
