#### Questions

> In your own words, explain the essential differences between `props` and `state` in React. Which is immutable or read-only, and which changes? Submit your response in the submission text area and discuss the answer with your mentor.

A: `props` and `state` are both property objects of a component that enable communication with other components or the user interface.  The major difference between the two is as follows. A parent component can only send its `props` to its children (unidirectional flow) and it cannot change the `props` (immutable data). On  the other hand, a component can manage (mutate) its own `state`.
